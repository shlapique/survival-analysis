# Survival Analysis project (*Chronic Granulomatous Disease*) 

In this project we've found, that the probability of survival decreases over time. The more time passes, the greater the hazard risk.
Also in our sample women are slightly more likely to survive than men. The survival rate in the older age groups is ~8% higher than in the younger ones. We also found that if a patient takes a drug rather than a placebo, the chance of death drops significantly -- by ~68%.
